DO Together
    
Write a program that uses an array(s)  to keep track of 
employees and the number of years they have been at the 
company.  Then let the user add a new employee and years 
of service, and delete the last employee added.  Output the 
arrays, one name per line, before the array has been changed, 
after a new employee is added, and after the last employee 
is deleted. 

Use array(s), array method(s), for loop(s), and if/else 
statement(s). 

Use this data: 

Mary Edwards, 22 years, Don Smith, 10 years, Tricia Evans, 5 years
